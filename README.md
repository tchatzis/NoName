# NoNameGame

Some things I've done with THREE.js

I'll try to provide some documentation at some point in the future.

In the meantime, I'd like to thank Mr. Doob, WestLangley, Michael Herzog, Lee Stemkoski and Jerome Etienne, amongst others, whose countless hours of work, have made my sleepless nights bear some fruit.
